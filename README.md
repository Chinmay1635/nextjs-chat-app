# 💬 Chat Modal with Backend API (Next.js + MongoDB)

This project is a full-stack chat interface built using **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MongoDB Atlas**. It includes a floating action button that opens a chat modal where users can send messages, which are stored in the backend using Next.js API routes. The UI is clean, minimal, and built without any external UI libraries.

> 🔧 This project was developed as part of an assignment for the **Next.js Developer Internship** at **CareerSecure**.
